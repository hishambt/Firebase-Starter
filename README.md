# Ionic Angular Firebase Starter

This repository is a starter template for building a web or mobile app using Ionic, Angular, and Firebase. It provides a solid foundation for creating modern, scalable, and real-time applications. Whether you're building a web app or a mobile app for iOS and Android, this template can save you time and help you get started quickly.

## Features

- **Ionic Framework**: This template is built using the Ionic framework, which provides a set of UI components and tools for building responsive and attractive user interfaces.

- **Angular**: The app is powered by Angular, a powerful and popular JavaScript framework that enables you to build dynamic and interactive web and mobile applications.

- **Firebase Integration**: Firebase is used as the backend for this template. Firebase provides real-time database, authentication, cloud functions, and more, making it easy to build powerful and scalable apps.

- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication is integrated into this template, allowing users to sign up, log in, and securely access their data.

- **Cloud Functions**: Firebase Cloud Functions are used for serverless backend logic, allowing you to run code in response to events and integrate with external services.

- **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is integrated for push notifications, keeping your users engaged and informed.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use `git clone` to clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:hishambt/Firebase-Starter.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project folder and install the necessary dependencies using npm.

   ```bash
   cd Firebase-Starter
   npm ci
   ```

3. **Set Up Firebase**: Create a Firebase project at [https://firebase.google.com/](https://firebase.google.com/) if you don't already have one. Then, configure your Firebase credentials in the project by replacing the Firebase configuration in `src/environments/environment.ts` with your own credentials.

   ```typescript
   export const environment = {
     production: false,
     firebaseConfig: {
       apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
       authDomain: 'YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN',
       projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
       storageBucket: 'YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET',
       messagingSenderId: 'YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID',
       appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID'
     }
   };
   ```

   ```bash
   npm run firebase login
   npm run firebase init
   ```

4. **Run the App**: You can now start the app on your local development server.

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Customize and Build**: Customize the app to meet your project requirements by editing the source files in the `src` folder. You can also build the app for different platforms using the Ionic CLI.

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Deploy**: Deploy your app to Firebase hosting (github workflow included) or your preferred hosting provider. Refer to the [Ionic Deployment Documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/deployment) for detailed instructions.
